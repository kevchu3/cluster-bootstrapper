This project focuses on integrating External Secrets Management solutions with OpenShift clusters to enhance cloud-native security practices. By leveraging the automation capabilities of Ansible, the project streamlines the setup of base operators for managing secrets across multiple cloud providers, such as AWS and Azure, directly within Kubernetes environments. This approach mitigates the risks associated with hardcoded or poorly managed secrets, thus solving a critical problem in cloud security and DevOps.

## Why This Pattern

The adoption of this pattern is motivated by the need for secure, automated secrets management in cloud-native applications. Managing secrets effectively reduces potential attack vectors and simplifies compliance with security standards. This pattern is particularly applicable in environments where security and automation are paramount, offering a scalable way to manage sensitive configurations without compromising security.

## How It Works

The project utilizes Ansible roles and collections to configure and deploy External Secrets Operators in an OpenShift cluster. These operators interact with cloud-specific secrets management services (like Azure Key Vault or AWS Secrets Manager) to dynamically inject secrets into the cluster, ensuring that applications have access to up-to-date credentials without direct access to the secret stores themselves.

## How to Implement

To implement this pattern in your project, follow these steps:

1. Prepare Your Environment: Ensure you have access to an OpenShift cluster and the necessary cloud provider accounts.
2. Configure Ansible: Set up Ansible with the required collections and roles as detailed in the provided playbook examples.
3. Customize Variables: Adjust the variables in vars.yaml to match your cloud provider and secrets configuration.
4. Execute the Playbook: Run the Ansible playbook to deploy the External Secrets Operator and configure it to work with your secret store.

Refer to the linked Slide Deck for an in-depth exploration of the configuration and deployment processes.

## Getting Started

To kickstart your project:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install Ansible and the necessary collections for Kubernetes and OpenShift management.

## Prerequisites

- Access to an OpenShift cluster.
- Ansible installed on your local machine.
- Cloud provider accounts and configured permissions for secrets management.

```
sudo apt update && sudo apt install ansible
ansible-galaxy collection install community.okd community.kubernetes
```
